    "- with the \"naive\" approach below no vector data base is stored to the given directory, so that the embeddings will most likely not be reused and have to be created each time a new question is prompted, this is quite expensive.\n",

By using ai_models and scraping websites data can easily be collected and structured, also labeling data and sentiment analysis are great possibilities to leverage the marvin library. ai_applications like used here are also very impressing, but by giving marvin the tools and rights to read and write seems to be unsafe for my environment ... since the magic lays in prompt engineering here, words have to be chosen carefully and are prone to misunderstandings\n",
